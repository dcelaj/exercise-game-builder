This is just gonna use the cam and media pipe to generate some pose data and store them in a text file.
I input what class I'm gathering data for, a timer starts giving me some time to get in position, and
then it takes a bunch of pictures as I strike the pose for that class. A few rounds of this maybe, so
I can vary the proper pose.
